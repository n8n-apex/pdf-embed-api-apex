# Save User Preferences Sample

PDF Embed API does not save any user preferences by default. This sample demonstrates how certain user preferences (such as updated annotation colour, and coach mark after selecting any annotation tool) can be saved and remembered in the browser.
In this example, the user preferences are saved in the local storage of the website domain.

To see it in action, copy the files in the folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.
