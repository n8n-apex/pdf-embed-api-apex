# Sample for Bookmark APIs

This sample shows how to fetch and open bookmarks in the PDF programmatically.

A custom left hand pane has been created. Upload a PDF file from local storage and the bookmarks available in the PDF are listed in this pane.
Click on any bookmark link to navigate to the particular PDF page containing that bookmark.

To see it in action, copy the files in the folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.
