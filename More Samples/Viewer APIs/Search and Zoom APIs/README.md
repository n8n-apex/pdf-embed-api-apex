# Sample for Search and Zoom APIs

This sample shows how to perform search and zoom operations on the PDF programmatically using the Search and Zoom Viewer APIs.

### Search APIs

A custom search bar has been created which can be used to enter any term. Click on the search button to search for that term in the PDF and traverse through the search results. Click on the Clear button to cancel the search operation.

### Zoom APIs

Custom zoom controls have been created which can be used to increase and decrease the PDF zoom level. 
To set a particular zoom level, enter the value in the box and the page view changes according to the zoom level.

To see the APIs in action, copy the files in the folder to your computer, and open index.html in a supported browser.
